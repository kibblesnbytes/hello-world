# hello-world
please welcome Rick to (his new) world of computing.  he will contribute. 
So, i did a whole bunch of Biochemistry and was completely disinterested, disheartened and disatisfied.  Worst still, i did nothing about it despite having a sincere passion for computers and technology coupled with a much stronger performance record in math and pure and applied sciences.  much stronger. 
so now, all of these years later. i'm back. or maybe i'm just arriving for the first time.  either way, the (new) direction is the same. i'm here to contribute to make my life and anyone else that i can help, better.
