# hello-world
please welcome Rick to (his new) world of computing.  he will contribute. 
please don't mind the syntax and grammatical errors
So, i did a whole bunch of Biochemistry and was completely disinterested, disheartened and disatisfied with my ultimate achievement of Master's in Science.  Worse still, i did nothing about it despite having a sincere passion for computers and technology coupled with a much stronger performance record in math and pure and applied sciences.  much stronger. 
so now, all of these years later, i'm back.  or perhpas i'm just arriving for the first time.  either way, the (new) direction is to program my way out of rewiring my environmentally induced depression.  i'm here to contribute to make my life and anyone else that i can help, better. by programming. reprogramming. engineering. reverse engineering. information gathering. and hopefully helpful application building.  
i'm not shy to admit that i need a profit from this as much as i want a profit from this.  
so despite feeling incredibly foolish typing to myself in this estranged GitHub window - i'm battling those demons that are currently telling me i can't do it, i won't do it, or i shouldn't do it.  
just do it.
